                    <h3>SEC Materials</h3>
                    <p>Certain information provided through this website has been furnished or filed with the Securities and
                        Exchange Commission ("SEC") (such materials being referred to as "SEC Materials"). The SEC Materials
                        and other public disclosures contained on this website contain forward-looking statements within the
                        meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically
                        identified by words or phrases such as likely, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate,
                        position and variations of such words and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such
                        as will, would, should, could, may or similar expressions. DigitalBridge cautions that these
                        forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, all of
                        which change over time, and DigitalBridge assumes no duty to update forward-looking statements.
                        Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
                        and future results could differ materially from historic performance.</p>
                    <p>The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from
                        forward-looking statements or historic performance: the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing
                        of business initiatives and strategies; economic conditions; changes in interest rates and financial
                        and capital markets; competitive conditions; capital improvement projects; future acquisitions; and
                        the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and legislative and regulatory actions and
                        reforms.</p>
                    <p>Reference is made to DigitalBridgeâ€™s filings with the SEC which identify additional factors that can
                        affect forward-looking statements.</p>
