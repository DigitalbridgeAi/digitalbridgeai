                                <p>Marc C. Ganzi is Chief Executive Officer at DigitalBridge and has been an investor and
                                    operator in the digital infrastructure sector for more than 25 years.&nbsp; Mr. Ganzi
                                    has led DigitalBridge&rsquo;s transformation to become a premier platform for digital
                                    infrastructure and real estate investment.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Ganzi originally founded Digital Bridge Holdings in 2013 and, as its CEO, built the
                                    firm into a leading global manager of digital infrastructure assets with more than $20
                                    billion in AUM, until its merger in July 2019 into the current public company,
                                    DigitalBridge Group, Inc.</p>
                                <p>Previously, Mr. Ganzi founded Global Tower Partners (&ldquo;GTP&rdquo;), which grew to
                                    become one of the largest privately-owned tower companies in the U.S. under his
                                    leadership before being acquired by American Tower Corporation in 2013 for $4.8 billion.
                                    At GTP, Mr. Ganzi executed a series of strategic acquisitions, build-to-suit agreements

                                    wireless and wireline communication sites in the United States. In 2000, Apex merged
                                    with SpectraSite Communications to create one of the largest telecommunications site
                                    portfolios in the United States at the time.</p>
                                <p>In 1990, Mr. Ganzi served as an assistant Commercial Attach&eacute; in Madrid for the

                                    The FreshWave Group (&ldquo;FreshWave&rdquo;).</p>
                                <p>In 2014, Mr. Payne co-founded Opencell, the UK&rsquo;s first carrier-approved indoor
                                    mobile signal service provider and the first to be able to deliver in-building coverage

                                <p>Mr. Payne has long been at the heart of the mobile industry, having been involved in the
                                    inception of GSM in the 1990&rsquo;s. He worked as the Planning and Deployment Director
                                    for T-Mobile in the UK and Rollout Manager for the T-Mobile International.</p>
                                <p>In 2007, Mr. Payne took a leading role in negotiating the largest network consolidation
                                    agreement in the world at that time. Following this successful negotiation, he was asked
                                    to establish and become Managing Director of MBNL, the joint venture between EE and
                                    Three. The consolidation was successfully consummated in October 2010 and continues to
                                    deliver significant benefits to its shareholders today. After leaving MBNL in 2014, Mr.
                                    Payne provided executive consultancy on network sharing and radio network projects,
                                    including executive level support to Vodafone on the Beacon project with Telefonica and
                                    CTIL, which helped transform delivery and enable large scale 4G rollout for both.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Payne serves on the Board of Directors of FreshWave and is a valued adviser to
                                    numerous global mobile connectivity groups.</p>
