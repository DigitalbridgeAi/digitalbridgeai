                        information. In general, we can process your personal information lawfully because we have a
                        legitimate interest in doing so, to pursue the purposes that we have set out above. We may also need
                        to process your personal information in order to perform our legal obligations.</p>
                    <h3 id="infoweshare">Information We Share</h3>
                    <p>We do not sell or otherwise share personal information about you, except as described in this Privacy
                        Policy. We may share personal information with third parties (e.g., service providers) who perform
                        services on our behalf. These third parties are not authorized by us to use or disclose the
                        information, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal
                        requirements. We may also share the personal information we obtain with other organizations involved
                        in the management of the relevant fund and with our affiliates or subsidiaries.</p>
                    <p>We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or
                        legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government
                        agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, (iii) for the purpose of or in connection with legal
                        proceedings, or otherwise for the purpose of establishing, exercising or defending our legal rights,
                        or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial
                        loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We also reserve
                        the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a
                        portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution,
                        liquidation or other corporate event).</p>
                    <p>The disclosures of personal information referred to above include transfers of personal information
                        which is subject to UK or European Union data protection laws to countries outside the UK, EU, the
                        Cayman Islands Data Protection Law, California Consumer Protection Privacy (“CCPA”) and various
                        other worldwide privacy regulations. DBRG is an international group of companies, headquartered in
                        the U.S., and it has funds, affiliates and service providers, and relationships with counterparties
                        and governmental authorities, all over the world. This includes transfers to countries, such as the
                        U.S., which are not regarded by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of data
                        protection. Where we transfer personal information subject to UK or European Union data protection
                        laws to our service providers, other organizations involved in the management of the relevant fund
                        or affiliated companies in those countries, we do so on the basis of data transfer agreements
                        designed to protect the privacy of your information, in forms approved for this purpose by the
                        European Commission.</p>
                    <h3 id="recordkeeping">Record-Keeping</h3>
                    <p>The period for which we will keep your personal information varies depending on the information and
                        how we obtained it. Personal information will not be held for longer that it is needed, given the
                        purposes for which it is held. Further information regarding our record-keeping policies is
                        available upon request.</p>
